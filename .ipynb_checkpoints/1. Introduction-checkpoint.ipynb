These files have been uploaded in the `nex templates` and `nex scripts` folder, and **they will need to be placed in your NeuroExplorer Templates and Scripts folders, respectively** (default: `Documents/NeuroExplorer 5/Templates` and `Documents/NeuroExplorer 5/Scripts`).  Each notebook will briefly explain the processing done in NeuroExplorer to export the appropriate data for each plot.  For the purposes of demonstration, these notebooks will use some of our real pilot data which has been uploaded in the folder `exampledata`.\n",
